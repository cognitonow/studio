## Architecture & Refactoring

### Full Backend & Database Migration Plan

This section outlines the analysis and steps required to migrate the application from the current mock data (`src/lib/data.ts`) to a production-ready backend using Firebase Data Connect and a PostgreSQL database.

#### Phase 1: Defining the Database Schema (Low-to-Medium Effort)

This phase involves creating the structure for your PostgreSQL database. You will define your tables and their relationships in the `dataconnect/schema/` directory.

- **Create Table Schemas**: For each core data type in `src/lib/types.ts` (`User`, `Provider`, `Service`, `Booking`, etc.), create a corresponding `.gql` file.
- **Define Columns & Types**: Map TypeScript types to SQL types (e.g., `string` -> `String`, `number` -> `Int`).
- **Establish Relationships**: Define foreign key relationships between tables (e.g., a `Booking` links to a `Provider` and a `User`).

#### Phase 2: Rewriting Data Access Functions (High Effort)

This is the most time-consuming phase, involving a rewrite of `src/lib/data.ts` to replace mock data functions with real database calls.

- **Remove Mock Data**: All hardcoded arrays (`providers`, `bookings`, `reviews`, etc.) will be deleted.
- **Implement Queries (Reading Data)**:
  - For every function that *retrieves* data (e.g., `getProviders`, `getBookingById`), define a **query** in the relevant `.gql` file.
  - Update the function in `data.ts` to call this query using the Data Connect SDK.
  - **Example**: `getProviderById(id)` will change from `providers.find(p => p.id === id)` to a Data Connect query like `Provider.get({ id: id })`.
- **Implement Mutations (Writing Data)**:
  - For every function that *changes* data (e.g., `addBooking`, `updateBookingStatus`), define a **mutation** in the relevant `.gql` file.
  - Update the function in `data.ts` to call this mutation.
  - **Example**: `addBooking(bookingData)` will change from `bookings.unshift(newBooking)` to calling an `insertBooking` mutation with the booking data.
- **Refactor AI Flows**: The AI-generated messages will need to be adapted to work with the data returned from your real database, but the core logic of calling the flows will remain the same.

This migration centralizes backend changes to the data layer, minimizing impact on UI components and providing a clear path to a production-ready application.


## Future Backend Features (Cloud Functions)

This section outlines common and powerful Cloud Functions that could be used to build a robust backend for the marketplace.

### üõçÔ∏è Product & Listing Management
- **onProductCreate/onProductUpdate**: A Firestore trigger that runs whenever a seller adds or updates a product.
  - Create a searchable index of your products in a service like Algolia or Typesense.
  - Check the product description and images for inappropriate content using the Cloud Vision API.
- **onProductDelete**: A Firestore trigger that cleans up related data when a product is deleted.
  - Remove it from the search index.
  - Delete its associated images from Cloud Storage.

### üí≥ Orders & Payments
- **createStripeCheckoutSession**: A callable function that securely communicates with a payment processor like Stripe to create a payment session.
- **stripeWebhook**: An HTTP trigger that listens for events from Stripe (e.g., successful payment) to:
  - Update the order status in Firestore.
  - Decrement the product's stock quantity.
  - Send confirmation emails to the buyer and seller.

### üë§ User & Seller Management
- **onUserCreate**: An Authentication trigger that runs when a new user signs up to:
  - Create a corresponding user profile document in Firestore.
  - Set a default user role (e.g., `role: 'buyer'`).
  - Send a welcome email.
- **requestSellerUpgrade**: A callable function that allows a user to request to become a seller, potentially triggering an admin approval workflow.

### ‚≠ê Reviews & Ratings
- **onReviewCreate**: A Firestore trigger that runs when a new review is submitted.
  - It can automatically calculate the new average rating for the product and update the product's document in the database, preventing the need for expensive client-side calculations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Maintenance & Moderation
- **dailyCleanup**: A scheduled function that runs automatically to perform routine tasks like:
  - Deleting abandoned shopping carts.
  - Calculating and processing seller payouts.
  - Generating daily sales reports.
